        <p class="indent">Font types are a varied and necessary part of typography. For readable articles and eye-catching logos alike, 
            their purpose must be achieved to be successful. As a user, I perfer readability over all else. As a designer, however,
            I can't help but appreciate some of the artistry present for more atypical fair. I've chosen fonts out of my comfort zone
            and one of my personal favorites for this project. To see their page, click on the image provided below. Please note they do 
            not take you to a new tab at this time, that must be clicked manually.</p>
        <h2>Stack Sans Notch</h2>
        <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Stack+Sans+Notch?preview.text=The%20quick%20brown%20fox%20jumped%20over%20the%20lazy%20dog"><img src="typoimages/StackSansNotchEX.png" alt="The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog written in Stack Sans Notch"></a>
        <p class="indent">From Google Fonts. As a sans serif font, Stack Sans Notch is a font of mild aesthetic. It is perfectly 
            readable, but not entirely fitting of the function of sans serif. The titular notch and off-kitler angles of 
            some letters are rather distracting. Depending on the size of the font, it isn’t completely noticeable either, 
            defeating the point. I would argue the font is more appropriate for logos than sans serif typical readability. 
            Which, to be fair, does seem to be the true intention and falls under sans serif as it is the best category 
            it could be under. </p>
        <h2>Fleur De Leah</h2>
        <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fleur+De+Leah?preview.text=The%20Quick%20Brown%20Fox%20Jumped%20Over%20the%20Lazy%20Dog&categoryFilters=Feeling:%2FExpressive%2FFancy"><img src="typoimages/FleurDeLeahEX.png" alt="The Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over the Lazy Dog written in Fleur De Leah"></a>
        <p class="indent">From Google Fonts. A formal script font, Fleur De Leah is rather beautiful. Unfortunately, as a script 
            font, it is not entirely readable. Still, I can’t help but appreciate the touch of every capital 
            letter that appears to be like ivy. It gives it a lot of character, I can easily see it being used for 
            various floral-themed businesses or affairs branding. Even as a script, the cursive is rather 
            intuitive and easier to read than some alternatives.</p>
        <h2>Bitter</h2>
        <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter?preview.text=The%20quick%20brown%20fox%20jumped%20over%20the%20lazy%20dog"><img src="typoimages/BitterEX.png" alt="The quick brown fox jumped over the leazy dog written in Bitter"></a>
        <p class="indent">From Google Fonts. A “slab” serif font, and a personal favorite. As a frequent user of google docs, 
            sometimes you have to change fonts to not get bored of what you are writing. Bitter has been my go-to 
            font for a few years now. Breathable and easy to read, this font was crafted very carefully to achieve 
            its goals. Size 12 is frankly perfect for what I need, no matter the project. It makes computer text 
            incredibly easy to read and even easier to write. What it lacks in personality it more than makes up for 
            in usability. Whenever I start up a new doc, I immediately change the font to bitter to get the work done 
            as efficiently as possible.</p>
