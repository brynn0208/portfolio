        <p>Hello there, this is my first site designed for my work-in-progress webdesign course. As 
            such this is a bit rough, so please forgive the mess at the moment. Here I hope to share 
            my corresponding coursework and (ficticious) resume. Please inform me if anything is not
            working as intended via the email below. Thank you so much for stopping by, and have a 
            great day and wonderful week!</p>
